# Low_pass_filter_system_based_on_on_channel_FPGA
This project is based on the Anlu FPGA development board and mainly includes modules such as an FIR filter, a homemade DDS signal generator, an ADC-FMC driver, an Ethernet module, and a Python oscilloscope, used for the reception and transmission of digital signals. The DDS works in conjunction with the ADC-FMC to generate accurate digital signals, simulating different waveforms and frequencies, offering flexibility and control. The ADC-FMC driver ensures stable operation of the module, with performance optimization and programmability to meet diverse needs. The FIR filter, being the core of digital signal processing, features high-precision filtering, programmability, and noise suppression, ensuring signal quality. The Ethernet module transmits the filtered signals to the host computer through a gigabit network interface, featuring a high-performance AXI4-Lite interface, Client Send functionality, and Soft-FIFO buffering, ensuring the reliability of data transmission and processing. The Python oscilloscope is used for data visualization, enhancing the convenience and flexibility of data processing, and supports advanced signal analysis and monitoring. The coordinated design and logical assembly of these core components lay a solid foundation for efficient signal processing, achieving orderly timing control and real-time data transmission.
